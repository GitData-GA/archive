While dense retrieval models have significantly advanced retrieval performance, their reliance on large-scale training datasets hampers their effectiveness in multilingual settings. In this work, we propose two complementary strategies to improve data efficiency and robustness in CIR model fine- tuning. First, we introduce a paraphrase-based query augmentation pipeline leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enrich scarce training data, thereby promoting more robust and language-agnostic representations. Second, we present a weighted InfoNCE loss that emphasizes underrepresented languages, ensuring balanced optimization across heterogeneous linguistic inputs. Experiments on cross-lingual benchmark datasets demonstrate that our combined approaches yield substantial gains in retrieval quality, outperforming standard training protocols on small and imbalanced datasets. These results underscore the potential of targeted data augmentation and reweighted objectives to build more inclusive and effective CIR systems, even under resource constraints."}, {"jsonID": "20241230073542", "url": "https://archive.gd.edu.kg/20241230073542/", "title": "Curriculum Leaning For Autonomous Vehicles", "subject": "Data Science / Statistics (Machine Learning)", "version": "Version 1", "publication_date": "2024/12/30", "authors": ["Luc Chen", "Michelle Chang", "Theo Lebryk"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning (RL)", "Curriculum Leaning", "Autonomous Vehicles", "MDP", "Reward Function"], "abstract": "This study investigates how the sequence of training environments affects performance in simple driving tasks for an autonomous driving agent. By training agents solely through interaction with maps of varying difficulty, we demonstrate that transfer learning enhances performance within single-environment driving scenarios. However, we find that agents struggle to master advanced driving capabilities and fail to generalize well to new environments, regardless of the sequence of training data. We conclude by looking at areas to build on this work such by combining imitation learning with curriculum learning and developing curriculum-specific MDP.
