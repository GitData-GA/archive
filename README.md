# GitData Archive

A preprint is a scientific manuscript that authors post on an open platform (usually before or in parallel with the journal's peer review process). GitData Archive is an open access online archive and service for preprints.

The purpose of GitData Archive is to increase the openness and accessibility of scientific results, increase collaboration among researchers, document the origins of ideas, and inform ongoing and planned research through more timely reporting of completed studies.

By posting preprints on GitData Archive, authors have the opportunity to instantly familiarize the scientific community with the results of their research and receive feedback from colleagues before publication in the journal.

Content on GitData Archive is pre-moderated, but not reviewed. You can search through uploaded preprints or view the latest uploaded preprints in your area of interest.
